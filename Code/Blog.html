        <h3>"The book is dead, long live the book."</h3>
        <p>Technology has its control over 21st century from health to communication, to security to ecommerce. It has
            introduced a lot of new, modern and useful factors by which costumer enjoys shopping. Since the last 20
            years, the ecommerce industry is growing significantly. As technology transforms business-to-consumer
            transactions, consumers can use a variety of tools to estimate pricing, compare options, locate businesses,
            and receive coupons. The use of ecommerce technologies helps to increase sales performance in the virtual
            store through automaiton, and other things.

            Digital technology have a significant impact on the traditional publishing and retailing businesses and it
            has also given the book a new lease on life. "Literature found itself at war with the internet," says jim
            hinks, digital editor of Comma press. But its exactly opposite to its expectation because both the
            publishers and retailers as gain a new way to bring out their books in the market. This not only is fruitful
            to the retailes and publishers but also to the readers.

            Due to the technology, the transactions are much more simple and easier then they were before. For the
            customer, the credit cards and the rise of ecommerce have made it easier than ever for firms to sell their
            items when they want. Technology has made marketing more easier, more successful and cost-effective which
            helps to boost the coporate strategy. Previously, the companies were limited to advertise their goods.
            Whoever has a little bit of fund they used newspaper and television and radio to advertise. But other
            copanies couldn't do the same thing. But nowadays, internet has made our advertise pop up everywhere so that
            people could reach out to them. It's easier to find your target audience, understand their wants, and engage
            with them on a personal level when you market your business online.

            Not everyone can afford to go to college. Many people who would like to further their education are unable
            to do so because they are employed, caring for families, or live too far away from their local institution
            to commute. All of that has altered thanks to online programs. Students can now enroll in online programs or
            take single classes at their leisure, without having to leave their homes.
