        <div class="content">
            <p>One indian girl is an indian book written by indian author 'Chetan Bhagat'. The book is about the girl
                name Radhika Mehta who is a worker at the distressed debt group of Goldman sachs, the investment bank.
                Radhika is making plans for her marriage with Brijesh Gulati, a software developer for Facebook in San
                Francisco, at the start of the book. She later detailed her childhood and existence in Delhi, where she
                grew up as a studious, introverted, and nerdy middle-class girl. Aditi, Radhika's older sister, was the
                more attractive, outgoing, and popular student at their school. </p>
            <p>
                She also told her inner judgmental voice, or "mini-me," about her thoughts and decisions. The tale
                returns
                to the present day. Radhika cancels her wedding because she is overworked and under pressure as a result
                of the wedding festivities
                as well as the presence of both of her ex-boyfriends at her wedding resort. She also speaks with Neel
                and Debu, rejecting their offers, before deciding to take a vacation and travel. Radhika meets up with
                Brijesh four months later and the two decide to have coffee together. The book ends here, implying that
                Radhika and Brijesh would most likely date again, fall in love, and marry.

            <p>Chetan Bhagat's eighth novel, and his tenth overall, is titled The Girl in Room 105. On the basis of
                pre-arranged sales alone, the book became a bestseller. It narrates the story of an IIT coaching class
                tutor who goes to wish his ex-girlfriend a happy birthday and discovers she has been murdered. The rest
                of the novel follows his attempt to find justice for his ex-girlfriend after she dies. In addition, the
                book discusses stereotypes and political difficulties in India.</p> 
            <p>The story begins with Chetan Bhagat, the book's author, conversing with a fellow passenger on a late
                Indigo flight from Hyderabad to Delhi. Chetan agrees to listen to the fellow's narrative after an
                initial dialogue. Keshav is a former IIT student who now works as a JEE tuition center teacher. He
                despises his job and uses LinkedIn to look for work, but he is unable to find a suitable position. He
                comes from a religious family. His mother is a stay-at-home mom, and his father works for the RSS. He is
                in love with a coworker named Zara Lone, who is a Ph.D. student at IIT. Zara is from a Kashmiri Muslim
                household, and their love story comes to an end owing to their families' religious differences. Keshav
                can't get out of it and keeps thinking about Zara, who later falls in love with Raghu (Keshav's
                classmate). Raghu is an intellectual man with a geeky appearance. Zara is a name Keshav frequently uses.

            <p>Amar Neupane's novel Seto Dharti is a Nepali novel. FinePrint Publication published it in 2012. It is
                the author's second work, following Paniko Gham, which he wrote previously. It was awarded the Madan
                Puraskar, Nepal's highest literary honor.The plot is based on the life of Tara, a little girl. She is a
                simple girl who spends her time in her
                hamlet playing with other local youngsters. As the story progresses, she marries at the age of
                seven, despite the fact that she has no understanding of what marriage entails. The novel's story
                takes place between 1850 and 1950, when child marriage was quite widespread in Nepalese society.
                Tara's spouse is required to travel to Banaras for his studies, where he dies. Tara, a nine-year-old
                girl, will now have to live the rest of her life as a child widow.</p>
            <p> As the novel progresses, Tara's
            life is beset by a series of challenges. She returns to her father's house after visiting her
            spouse. She attempts to live a quiet life, attempting to forget all of the suffering she had as a
            youngster. Her mother dies later, and she is forced to assume full responsibility for the household.
            She leaves her father's house as an adult because she is abused by her stepmother and moves to
            Devghat, a Hindu sacred site. She builds a little hut there and begins a long, monotonous life.
            The major goal of the story is to expose the heinous cultural practice of child marriage and juvenile
            widowhood. This narrative depicts the agony of a child widow who has been alone her entire life. The
            work does its best to portray the harsh realities of Nepalese society, in which women must suffer
            greatly before many harmful practices are eradicated.</p>

            <p>Sydney Green was born and bred in Brooklyn, yet her favorite neighborhood appears to change with the
                blink of an eye. Condos are springing up like weeds, FOR SALE signs are appearing out of nowhere, and
                her long-time neighbors are going. Sydney directs her frustration into a walking tour of her community's
                past and present, and finds an odd and unwanted assistant in one of the newcomers to the block—her
                neighbor Theo.
            </p>
            <p>However, Sydney and Theo's historical research swiftly devolves into paranoia and fear. Their neighbors
                may not have relocated to the suburbs after all, and the revitalization effort may be more dangerous
                than projected. When does a coincidence turn into a plot? When gentrification pushes people out, where do they go? Can
                Sydney and Theo keep their trust in each other and in themselves long enough to find out before they,
                too, vanish?</p>

                <p>Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad in 1997. It promotes financial literacy
                (financial education), financial independence, and wealth creation through asset investing, real
                estate investing, creating and owning businesses, and improving one's financial intelligence
                (financial IQ).</p>
                <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is written as a series of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life. The
                    titular "rich dad" is his friend's father, who amassed fortune through entrepreneurship and wise
                    investing, whereas the "poor dad" is Kiyosaki's own father, who he claims to have worked hard
                    throughout his life but never achieved financial security.</p>
